      <h1>The future of food</h1>
      <div id="container">
        <p>Here at The Growing Table, we only serve organic food to our customers. We do this, because organic food is <span>healthier</span>, is <span>fresher</span>, and is <span>better for the environment.</span></p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="box">
            <p><span>Health</span><br><br>
              Organic food is found to have more nutrients and omega-3 fatty acids than conventially grown food.
              Non-organic food is also shown to have significantly more Cadmium(A toxic metal) and even trace amounts of pesticides.
            </p>

          <div class="box">
            <p><span>Taste</span><br><br>
            Organic food tastes better due it being more fresh than conventionally grown foods. 
            This level of freshness is achieved by rotating crops frequently in order to make sure that crops are always grown in season. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <p><span>Environment</span><br><br>
            Organic food is grown completely free of GMOs, pesticides, and synthetic fertilizers which causes pollution. 
            Conventional farms even sometimes use radiation to control pests!
            Commonly rotating crops also help improve soil quality by not overusing certain nutrients.
